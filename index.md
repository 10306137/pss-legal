# Purple Strawberry Stories
**Short, emotional stories & guides — published as daily short‑form videos.**

Welcome to the official landing page for the Purple Strawberry Stories app integration with TikTok.  
This page hosts our public information, links, and support contacts.

## What we do
We create bite‑sized, emotionally resonant stories and self‑help guides, then publish them as short videos. Our internal tool connects to TikTok (with your permission) to upload approved videos to your account.

- Daily short video publishing
- Clear, supportive storytelling
- Built for creators and small brands

## How it works (high level)
1. You authorize our app via **TikTok Login**.  
2. We securely store OAuth tokens.  
3. Our tool uploads pre‑approved videos to your TikTok drafts (or directly, if enabled).  
4. You retain full control to edit or publish.

## Security & privacy
We request only the minimum scopes needed:  
- `user.info.basic` (identify your account)  
- `video.upload` (upload videos you authorize)

Tokens are stored securely and never sold or shared.  
For details, see our policies:
